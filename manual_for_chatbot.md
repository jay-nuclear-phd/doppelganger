    6. Take a pause at 50W to verify rod heights are similar to those of latest Reactivity Configuration calculation and days history of operation.

    7. Take a pause at 50W to verify rod heights are similar to those of latest Reactivity Configuration calculation and days history of operation.
    8. Adjust rods to stabilize power level at desired level.
    9. Press Auto Mode Switch when desired power is reached.
    10. Adjust rod heights to a bank position for best operation.
        
3. Square Wave Mode:
    
    Note: Testing has proven that maximum Square wave should be limited to 500kW.
    
    A. Sequences for square wave mode operation use transient rod (TR) positions that create a positive reactivity insertion as the rod moves from 0 to set position associated with the amount of reactivity desired to achieve desired power. At the time of actuation of the fire button, the core will be set at a steady state power less than 1 kW.
        1. Choose desired amount of reactivity to add from the movement of TR. (Amount added cannot be greater than 1 dollar (< $1.00). ($0.90 has proven during testing to be the best amount to add for square waves greater than 200kW)
        2. From TR rod worth data (CR worth calculator on the left) determine the rod position associated with the desired reactivity addition.
    B. Obtain steady state power on REG, shim 1 and shim 2, 800 watts is typical (<1kW):
        1. Withdraw REG rod to approximately 50% withdrawn position.
        2. Withdraw each shim rod in steps of 50 units or less.
        3. Monitor period and maintain as close to 20 seconds as possible while not going less than 10 seconds.
        4. Stabilize power by moving shim rods into a banked position while leaving REG rod at approximately 50% withdrawn position. 
        5. Place in auto mode. (optional)
    C. Initiate Square Wave:
        1. Verify transient rod is at 0% position.
        2. Check rod at low limit, turn air pressure off.
        3. Withdraw transient drive cylinder to position determined above.
        4. Check power <1kW. Place in manual mode.
        5. Set Demand Power to desired steady state power.
        6. Press Square Wave Switch. Verify SQUARE WAVE light illuminates and console system mode is SQUARE WAVE READY. 
        7. Press Fire switch. (System will switch to AUTO mode if demand power is reached in 10 seconds. System will switch to MANUAL mode if demand power is NOT reached in 10 seconds.)
        8. Adjust transient rod height as necessary to limit REG rod withdraw due to temperature coefficient effects.
        9. When power has stabilized, bank rods for BEST performance.

4. Sequences for the pulse mode operation use TR positions that create a positive reactivity insertion as the rod moves from a set position X to 100% WITHDRAWN. The motion of the control rod will thus cover the full range from 0% to 100%. At the time of actuation of the fire button, the core will be sub-critical by at least one dollar. Performance following this insertion will be expected to produce a 100% output within 10 milliseconds. 
   i. From TR rod worth curve calculate total reactivity gain for the TR 100% withdrawal position. 
   ii. Subtract the pulse insertion amount from 100% rod worth. (Maximum allowable Pulse is $3.00) 
   iii. Use the final rod worth and determine the initial height of TR rod on the rod worth table. This is the pre-pulse position of the TR for the initial 50 watt critical condition. 

	A. Obtain steady state power, 50W is typical. (< 1kW):
	    1. Withdraw Transient rod to the position calculated above.
	    2. Withdraw REG rod to approximately 50% withdrawn position.
	    3. Withdraw shim 1 and shim 2 in alternating 50 units or less increments.
	    4. Monitor period and maintain as close to 20 seconds as possible while not going less than 10 seconds.
	    5. Adjust REG, shim 1 and shim 2 rods alternately to maintain period.
	    6. Stabilize power and bank REG, shim 1 and shim 2 rods.
	B. Initiate Pulse Mode:

	    7. Verify mode is pulse ready.
	    8. Press Fire switch.
	    9. System will switch to SCRAM mode at conclusion of pulse to display the pulse data.
